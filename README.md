# Web Dev TA Notes

Term: 2021 Fall

❓ How to get your questions answered in open sessions? 

❗ Drop your questions on the weekly open-session piazza post! Be clear and concise! Make sure you read existing questions carefully to avoid repetition of questions. If you have questions about coding, come to the session and send over your related code snippet, we'll do live coding together.

**Note**: All questions answered will be documented in a markdown file which will be published in this repo after the session.
